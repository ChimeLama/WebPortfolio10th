                 <p> The < head > is making the head of the page while < /head > closes it inside the < head > we put < title > which makes the big title and the < /title > shows that we finished it.
                     The < body > is the middle part of the webpage we can put text in it by writting < h(every number)> the number represents the number of sentences you make but you must finish it with < /h(the number you put)>
                      We end the < body > with < /body >.WE can also use < p > that is for paragraph to write as a text.</p>
                 <p> I like cats,racoons,otters,and pandas.I'am here because technology seems to be a big part of the future and i didn't want to get left behind :> I actually joined this school because it was a CTE school and i caould earn money as a side job if i am
                     good at it.I want skills that will help me through out my life maybe i will get a job related to the course im taking !!.I've always wanted a job that will require me to stay home so i can hopefully travel alot.</p>
                          <p>I just connecte dmy replit to git hub n</p>
