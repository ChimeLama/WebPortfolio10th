             TrustWorthy
           </h1>
           <p class="textt"> To be trust worthy you have to earn trust first this can be done by being loyal and treating others the way you want to be treated.I treat others with kindness first but if they do not reciprocate it I would find that as a sign that they are not someone I want to be with.
  <br> Dictionary defines trustworthiness as being worthy of confidence, and being dependable
the ability to keep promises, to be honest, reliable and principled while never inappropriately betraying a confidence.</p><img src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trust-guide-3.png" height="100px">
